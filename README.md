# CarriAR

A website that allows carriers to show off phones with AR.

**Background**

Before the pandemic, the most common way to buy a phone was going to a carrier's store. This allows people to demo phones before buying one. However, this is no longer an option for most due to most stores either being shut down or socially distanced. Additionally, global shipping issues mean even the stores that are open may not have phones to demo.

**The problem**

Since stores are either closed or unable to demo phones, many people are instead purchasing online. However, this comes with many issues. For example, the customer can only see an image of the phone when shopping online. Because of this, someone could order a phone and be unhappy with it once it arrives. Since returning objects online takes much longer than it used to in-person, this should be avoided if possible.

**The solution**

<<<<<<< HEAD
CarriAR allows consumers to see the phones with their own eyes, in their own houses, through the power of EchoAR. Carriers can create a website with links to models of their phones, and then use that as a virtual demo. This has the benefits of customers examing the phones closely.
